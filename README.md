## Running the Pipeline

In order to operate the experiments, we must:

1. Run the benchmark (K-Means and Expectation Maximization)
2. Run the Dimensionality Reduction
3. Run Dimensionality Reduction with a specific dimension, run clustering, and run the neural net.

To keep all things equal, we are using the same features used in the previous experiment.
While This may seem silly, it is done to reduce complexity.
Further analysis should be done with other feature extraction techniques but the same pipeline.
